                At the beginning of the Build Phase, each player gets an allowance of new credits 
                depending on what turn it is and how well they did in the last round. The <b>Loser</b> 
                of the last round gets the full payout. Each player after that gets 5 fewer credits
                in the order of people who died.

            </p>
            <p class="rules"><b>Buying:</b>
                To get the weapons that you'll need to blow up other player's Mechs, and to get the 
                subsystems that you'll need to keep from being blown up, you'll spend the credits
                you have at the market to buy them. There are four handouts that detail all of the
                equipment in the game. You can look at them at any time, but you can only buy from
                them and put the equipment on your Mech during the Building phase.
            </p>
            <p class="rules">
                Most weapons and subsystems have unlimited stock, and will never sell out. The 
                number of such equipment you can equip on your Mech is limited only by the
                credits you have to spend on them and the space you have in your Mech. 
                <b>Unique Weapons and Subsystems</b> on the other hand require a card to unlock,
                and only have in stock the number that's in parentheses above their name on the
                unique subsystems page.
            </p>
            <p class="rules"><b>Building:</b>
                It is possible to build a Mech without equiping any weapons because empty weapon groups
		        are fitted with a exotritanium fist by default.
            </p>
            <p class="rules"><b>Selling:</b> 
                If you have weapons or subsystems that you don't want to use anymore, you can 
                sell them back to the market. Unless you have a card that says otherwise, when 
                you sell a weapon or subsystem, you get 50% of the market price, round down. 
            </p>
            <p class="rules">
                You cannot sell more than 4 weapons in a round. However, you can unequip weapons
                and/or equipment round by leaving it unused in your mech garage.
            </p>
            <p class="hint">
                So for example if you were selling a 17 credit Particle Cannon, then you'd get
                8 credits back. Some cards change the rate at which you can sell if you have
                them in your hand.
