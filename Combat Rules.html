                    Play during combat proceeds in turns with one player after another. During 
                    your turn, you may do one of the following five plays: move then attack, 
                    or attack then move, or idle which is neither moving nor attacking. You may
                    also move without attacking or attack without moving. 
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    Some tabletop games allow you to split your move action, allowing you to move,
                    then attack, then move again. In Mechanized, this requires a unique subsystem.

                <p class="rules"> 
                    Each Mech has a movement drive, which gives a speed measured in 
                    spaces. On each of your turns, if you chose to move, you may move
                    up to that number of spaces on unobstructed terrrain. For example,
                    if you have a move speed of 3, you could follow the red path pictured
                    to the right.

                <p class="rules"> 
                    Some Terrain obstructs your movement, which means that it costs 
                    more of your speed to move through it. For example, the light 
                    forest pictured in the gold path to the right penalizes movement
                    by 1 extra movement. As shown, the mech with a move speed of 3 
                    can only move 2 hexes along the gold path, since moving through 
                    the light forest took an extra space. Some terrain requires even
                    more movement than 1 extra to move through. See the Terrain Guide
                    rules page for specifics.

                    As long as you have some amount of movement left at the end of your
                    move, you can use it up to enter a hex of passable terrain. Consider
                    the third step along the purple path shown to the right. Though
                    the mech only has a speed of 3, and even though the mech used 2 of
                    its 3 speed getting to that second hex, it can still move into that
                    light forest as long as it ends its movement there.

                <p class="hint"> 
                    Different terrain offers different penalties not only to movement,
                    but also to your accuracy and evasion. Where you move to can often be the 
                    difference between victory or blowing up! If you want your mech to move faster,
                    you can buy upgrades to your movement drive subsystem during the build phase.

                    To attack another player's mech, choose which weapon you are attacking with,

                    listed on the weapon's range stat (or if you have a card that says otherwise).

                    for Accuracy Section" to see if you hit or not. If you hit, then you roll 
                    for damage. See the "rolling for damage" section below. You can attack with 
                    each of your weapons each turn. You may not attack with a weapon twice on a 
                    turn. You may decide not to use a weapon on a turn, for example if you wish
                    to preserve ammunition.

                <p class="rules">
                    To find out if your attack hit your opponenet, roll a 12 sided dice (often 
                    abreviated as d12) then add up all of your bonuses to accuracy and subtract
                    all of your penalties (sometimes called "maluses"). Look the resulting number
                    up on the accuracy scale below. If the number is below 5, then your attack
                    misses, and you deal no damage. If the number calculated is higher than 4, 
                    then your attack hit, and you get to roll damage (See the "roll for damage 
                    section next"). 
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    If the calculated number is higher than 7, then not only did 
                    you hit, but you were accurate enough to hit a weak point in your target's armor!
                    The numbers in the accuracy table below show how much extra damage EACH DICE you 
                    roll for damage gains. The damage bonus for accuracy cannot make a dice deal more 
                    than its maximum damage.

                    and her accuracy roll, penalties and bonus total 10, then she might get a +2
                    to each of the damage dice she rolls. If she rolls a 2 and a 6, then she deals
                    10 laser damage, since the roll of 6 cannot be improved, but the roll of 2 gets
                    a +2 to the damage from the accuracy.

                    When you hit, you roll the dice described in the damage section of your weapon, 
                    add any bonuses you get from cards or subsystems, and then tell your opponent 
                    how much total damage you dealt and what kind of damage you dealt. Damage types

                    The faster you move your mech, the harder it is for your pilot to aim. On the

                    of spaces you moved, regardless of the cost of speed of that movement. So if you
                    moved two spaces, one space through open terrain and another through heavy forest,
                    even though that movement cost 4 speed, you only moved 2 spaces. So your penalty 
                    to accuracy would be -1 from your movement. If you move after your attack this turn,
                    you have no penalty to your accuracy from your movement this turn.

                    The penalty to an enemy's accuracy is one less than the distance in spaces between
                    where you started and where you ended your move. So if you moved 3 spaces, your
                    opponenets would have a -2 to hit you.

                <p class="hint">
                    Tyler's mech is standing 3 spaces away from Abby's mech when tyler's attack 
                    destroys it. Abby had an Ion generator (level 3), two Phased Ion secondary 
                    generators (level 1 each), and a Light Hidron unique tertiary generator (level 2).
                    Abby's total generator level is 7. Since Tyler's mech is 3 spaces away, 7 - 3 = 4,
                    so Tyler's mech takes 4D4 nuclear damage from the explosion. If Charlie's mech is
                    5 spaces away, Charlie's mech takes no damage at all; even though Abby's generator
                    is level 7, Charlie is out of the 4 space maximum range for a nuclear explosion's 
                    damage.

                <p class="rules">
                    A player may decide to retreat from combat rather than fighting it out. To retreat,
                    the player's mech must not have had weapons used on them for the last 5 turns, and 
                    they must be on the edge of the map.

                <p class="rules">
                    In terms of calculating victory and in determining order for reward cards at the 
                    end of combat, the player's mech that retreated is considered to have been knocked 
                    out of the fight at the time of retreat.

                    Successfuly retreating gives the player an additional +5 credits during the next build phase.
