                    Play during combat proceeds in turns with one player after another. During 
                    your turn, you may do one of the following five plays: move then attack, 
                    or attack then move, or idle which is neither moving nor attacking. You may
                    also move without attacking or attack without moving. 
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    Some tabletop games allow you to split your move action, allowing you to move,
                    then attack, then move again. In Mechanized, this requires a unique subsystem.

                <p class="rules"> 
                    Each Mech has a movement drive, which gives a speed measured in 
                    spaces. On each of your turns, if you chose to move, you may move
                    up to that number of spaces on unobstructed terrrain. For example,
                    if you have a move speed of 3, you could follow the red path pictured
                    to the right.
                </p>
                <p class="rules"> 
                    Some Terrain obstructs your movement, which means that it costs 
                    more of your speed to move through it. For example, the light 
                    forest pictured in the gold path to the right penalizes movement
                    by 1 extra movement. As shown, the mech with a move speed of 3 
                    can only move 2 hexes along the gold path, since moving through 
                    the light forest took an extra space. Some terrain requires even
                    more movement than 1 extra to move through. See the Terrain Guide
                    rules page for specifics.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    You cannot move through spaces occupied by enemies. If you are playing
                    a team game, then you can move through friendly spaces with no additional
                    penalty.

                <p class="rules"> 
                    As long as you have some amount of movement left at the end of your
                    move, you can use it up to enter a hex of passable terrain. Consider
                    the third step along the purple path shown to the right. Though
                    the mech only has a speed of 3, and even though the mech used 2 of
                    its 3 speed getting to that second hex, it can still move into that
                    light forest as long as it ends its movement there.

                <p class="rules"> 
                    See the Terrain Guide page for specific details on the penalties
                    or bonuses to movement that each kind of terrain provides.

                <p class="hint"> 
                    Different terrain offers different penalties not only to movement,
                    but also to your accuracy and evasion. Where you move to can often be the 
                    difference between victory or blowing up! If you want your mech to move faster,
                    you can buy upgrades to your movement drive subsystem during the build phase.

                    All weapons can only fire once per turn.
                    Missiles can be fire at multiple targets in a
                    turn, but not the same target multiple times.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    To attack another player's mech, choose which weapon you are attacking with,
                    then choose which mech you are attacking. You may only choose an opponent's 
                    mech if it is a number of spaces equal to or less than the maximum range 
                    listed on the weapon's range stat (or if you have a card that says otherwise). 
                    Roll a die for accuracy, and add up your bonuses and penalties. See the "Rolling 
                    for Accuracy Section" to see if you hit or not. If you hit, then you roll 
                    for damage. See the "rolling for damage" section below. You can attack with 
                    each of your weapons each turn. You may not attack with a weapon twice on a 
                    turn. You may decide not to use a weapon on a turn, for example if you wish
                    to preserve ammunition.

                <p class="rules">
                    To find out if your attack hit your opponenet, roll a 12 sided dice (often 
                    abreviated as d12) then add up all of your bonuses to accuracy and subtract
                    all of your penalties (sometimes called "maluses"). Look the resulting number
                    up on the accuracy scale below. If the number is below 5, then your attack
                    misses, and you deal no damage. If the number calculated is higher than 4, 
                    then your attack hit, and you get to roll damage (See the "roll for damage 
                    section next"). 
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    If the calculated number is higher than 7, then not only did 
                    you hit, but you were accurate enough to hit a weak point in your target's armor!
                    The numbers in the accuracy table below show how much extra damage EACH DICE you 
                    roll for damage gains. The damage bonus for accuracy cannot make a dice deal more 
                    than its maximum damage.

                    If Alice is shooting Bob with a Large Proton Laser, which deals 2d6 damage,
                    and her accuracy roll, after penalties and bonuses totals 10, then she gets a +2
                    to each of the damage dice she rolls. If she rolls a 2 and a 6, then she deals
                    10 laser damage, since the roll of 6 cannot be improved, but the roll of 2 gets
                    a +2 to the damage from the accuracy.

                <p class="rules">
                    Target locks (aka missile locks) are a special type of accuracy roll. You can acquire
		    target locks at a range of 6 + computer accuracy bonus. Roll as for accuracy as normal
		    and ignore the damage bonus. If you are successful, then you have a target lock for this turn
		    and next turn. 
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    With a target lock, missiles can be launched at any time during your turn (but not to the same 
		    target twice in the same turn), provided you are within the missile's maximum range. For each missile 
		    launched, you have to make a d6 missile accuracy roll. The target's terrain and any special cards are 
		    the only modifiers to a missile accuracy role. Anything other than a roll of 1 (after modifiers) is a successful
		    hit and the target takes damage. If the target has e-pulse shielding or AMS subsystems, some or all of your 
		    successful missile hits will be shot down before the target takes damage.
		    Rolling a 6 for missile accuracy is always a hit. Rolling a 1 is not always a miss.
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    Alice has a target lock on Bob, and she is within 8 range for her H10 Halon Missiles. She fires all 10 missiles.
		    Bob is in level-2-depth water, so her missile accuracy rolls take a -2. She rolls 6, 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 4, & 3 thus
		    6 missiles can hit, but Bob has an LMS subsystem. LMSs shoot down 1d6+2, Bob rolls a 1, therefore 3
		    missiles are shot down. 3 halon missiles successfully hit for a total of 3 x 3 = 9 damage.

                    It takes a lot of energy to move your massive mech around and fire those huge guns.

                    other than moving and shooting.

                <p class="rules">
                    When your hit points drop below 1, your mech is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. 
                    To determine the size of the explosion, add the Generator Level (oft abreviated as 
                    "lvl") of all of your generators together. 
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    The maximum distance that a nuclear explosion can deal damage is 4 spaces away 
                    from the epicenter of the explosion. Damage is reduced by 1d4 for every space away 
                    from the spaces adjacent to the epicenter. In other words, if my mech blows up adjacent
                    to someone, they take the full nuclear explosion damage. That damage is reduced by
                    a cumulative -1d4 for each space further away from the explosion.
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    Tyler's mech is standing 3 spaces away from Abby's mech when Tyler's attack 
                    destroys it. Abby had an Ion generator (level 3), two Phased Ion secondary 
                    generators (level 1 each), and a Light Hidron unique tertiary generator (level 2).
                    Abby's total generator level is 7. Since Tyler's mech is 3 spaces away,  and the 1st 
                    space takes full damage, 7 - 2 = 4, so Tyler's mech takes 4d4 nuclear damage
                    from the explosion. Charlie's mech is 5 spaces away from Abby's, thus Charlie's mech
                    takes no damage at all; even though Abby's generator is level 7, Charlie is out of the
                    4 space maximum range for a nuclear explosion's damage.

                    A player may decide to retreat from combat rather than fighting it out. To retreat,
                    the player's mech must not have had weapon accuracy/target lock rolled against them 
                    for the last 5 turns, and they must be on the edge of the map.

                    In terms of calculating victory and in determining order for reward cards at the 
                    end of combat, the player's mech that retreated is considered to have been knocked 
                    out of the fight at the time of retreat.
