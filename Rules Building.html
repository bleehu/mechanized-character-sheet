                    At the beginning of the Build Phase, each player gets an allowance of new credits 
                    depending on what turn it is and how well they did in the last round. As a small 
                    compensation for getting first pick of cards, the winner gets -10 income. All players 
                    in the middle get -5 income, and the player that died first gets the full amount.

                <p class="rules"><b>Buying:</b>
                    To get the weapons that you'll need to blow up other player's Mechs, and to get the 
                    subsystems that you'll need to keep from being blown up, you'll spend the credits
                    you have at the market to buy them. There are four handouts that detail all of the
                    equipment in the game. You can look at them at any time, but you can only buy from
                    them and put the equipment on your Mech during the Building phase.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    Most weapons and subsystems have unlimited stock, and will never sell out. The 
                    number of such equipment you can equip on your Mech is limited only by the
                    credits you have to spend on them and the space you have in your Mech. 
                    <b>Unique Weapons and Subsystems</b> on the other hand require a card to unlock,
                    and only have in stock the number that's in parentheses above their name on the
                    unique subsystems page.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="subsystem">
            <p class="rules"><b>Selling:</b> 
                If you have weapons or subsystems that you don't want to use anymore, you can 
                sell them back to the market. Unless you have a card that says otherwise, when 
                you sell a weapon or subsystem, you get 50% of the market price, round down. 
            </p>
            <p class="rules">
                You cannot sell more weapons than take up 4 weapon space or 1 weapon that consumes 
                more than 4 weapon spaces, per round. However, you can unequip weapons
                and/or equipment round by leaving it unused in your mech garage.
            </p>
            <p class="hint">
                So for example if you were selling a 17 credit Particle Cannon, then you'd get
                8 credits back. Some cards change the rate at which you can sell if you have
                them in your hand.

                    <b>Building:</b>
                    It is possible to build a Mech without equipping any weapons because empty weapon groups
                    are fitted with a exotritanium fist by default.
                </p>

                <p class="rules">
                    <b>Power:</b>
                    Most subsystems and weapons have a power cost listed. This is the amount of energy that
                    your mech needs to generate in order to use that weapon or subsystem. If a weapon or 
                    subsystem doesn't list a power cost, it is safe to assume the power cost is zero.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    Your mech has a constant power level provided by your generators (and maybe your pilot
                    class). Some equipment, like batteries, can temporarily increase your power level should
                    you choose to use them in that way. You may only use weapons and equipment that are 
                    equiped to your mech if you have sufficient power to do so. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="hint">
                    It is generally advisable to simply run enough constant power to run all of your systems.
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    For example, let's say Trevor's mech has a Level 2 TFG primary power generator (which 
                    generates 12 power) and a PIG secondary generator (which generates 16 power), so Trevor's
                    power level is 28. So Trevor could power a T2 Computer Control System (which takes 14 power)
                    and a PES-5 Plasma Energy Shield (which also takes 14 power), but then he could not power his
                    PC Particle Cannon (which takes 5 power). Even though Trevor doesn't have enough power to 
                    run all of his weapons and systems, he could still decide to play this way. Trevor could 
                    simply re-route his power from his computer to his Particle Cannon at the start of his turn,
                    but if he did that, then the computer's bonus to accuracy wouldn't be granted when he fired,
                    since the computer would then be turned off.

                    <b>Weapon Groups:</b>
                    Each weapon lists a space requirment, this is the size of the weapon measured in weapon slots.
                    To equip a weapon on your mech, you must allocate the number of weapon slots on your mech
                    equal to the size of the given weapon. Furthermore, the slots that you allocate must be 
                    connected to each other. You can't take apart a large laser, put the inductors in your Mech's
                    shoulder and the barrel on your Mech's legs and expect it to work!
