	<h1>Pilot Classes</h1>
    <div class="subsystemtype">
        <p class="rules">
            At the start of the game you get to choose one pilot class, which gives your character 
            a helpful bonus. The class you select will be yours for the duration of the game;
            it cannot be changed mid-game. More than one player can choose the same class, but 
            no player can choose more than one class. 
        </p>
        <p class="hint">
            New players are encouraged to pick classes that are simple and easy to play, like 
            Mech Mechanic or Veteran, but feel free to pick the class that most interests you
            or fits the best with your strategy.

				<h3> Soldier of Fortune </h3>
				<p> The Soldier of fortune takes bounties on the players that they 
                    kill. They get a credit bonus every time they make the attack that
                    blows up an enemy. How much they get depends on how many 
                    players are in the game. In the event that the Soldier of Fortune's
                    mech is destroyed and its explosion causes the destruction of 
                    another player's mech, the soldier of fortune is credited for that
                    kill; however, if a Soldier of Fortune player's mech is destroyed by another 
					Soldier of Fortune player, and that explosion causes another mech to
					blow up, the player performing the attack gets credited for both kills (or more).</p>

				<h3> Veteran Soldier </h3>
				<p> The Veteran Soldier is more practiced at using their weapons in the heat
                    of combat. As such, they are slightly more accurate with them. The 
                    Veteran must select ONE of the following categories to specialize in.
                    For the duration of the game, they get a +1 to accuracy rolls when
                    using weapons of the chosen category. </p>

				<h3> Fusion Engineer </h3>
				<p> The Mech Engineer is talented at reducing the unnecessary resistance in their
                    Mech's electrical systems, and can squeeze a little more energy out of their reactors 
                    every round. They get a flat bonus to their mech's energy as detailed in the 
                    table below. </p>

				<h3> Mech Mechanic </h3>
				<p> The Mech Mechanic has the tools and skills to machine precision parts
                    that perform better. Their mech gets an additional +5 ammo storage.
                    If a mech mechanic gets shields, they get +5 strength. </p>

				<h3> Scavenger </h3>
                <p> 
                    The Scavenger can use their keen eye for recognizing specific valuable parts 
                    and their talent for restoring broken parts to gain information about opponents'
                    mechs and potentially salvage weapons from fallen foes.</p>
				<p> 
                    Whenever you occupy the hex that another mech exploded on this round, you can 
                    scavenge a weapon of your choice from that mech's weapon sheet. You may do this
                    as many times as you like during a round, and you may do this on allied and opposing 
                    mechs alike. At the end of the round, you may pick <b>ONE</b> of the weapons that 
                    you scavenged and either keep it for free, or sell it. When you sell a scavenged 
                    weapon, you get 25% of the cost of the weapon or you get 7 credits, whichever is
                    less.

				<h3> Banker </h3>
                <p> The Banker knows how to make aggressive short-term investments to leverage the market
                    so they can outspend their opponents. 
                </p>
				<p> At the start of every round, the Banker receives 20% interest on previously 
                    saved money (round up). Each money card that the Banker uses grants an additional +12 
                    credits <b>after round 1</b>. </p>

				<h3> Bitcoin Thief </h3>
				<p> The Bitcoin Thief gets a bonus for selling stolen IDs from opponents hacked during the fighting.
                    The Bitcoin Thief gets extra credits for each unique player hacked each round. How much they get
                    per successful hack depends on how many players are playing. The hacker must use a hacking 
                    subsystem to do hacking.
