	<h1>Pilot Classes</h1>
    <div class="subsystemtype">
        <p class="rules">
            At the start of the game you get to choose one pilot class, which gives your character 
            a helpful bonus. The class you select will be yours for the duration of the game;
            it cannot be changed mid-game. More than one player can choose the same class, but 
            no player can choose more than one class. 
        </p>
        <p class="hint">
            New players are encouraged to pick classes that are simple and easy to play, like 
            Mech Mechanic or Veteran, but feel free to pick the class that most interests you
            or fits the best with your strategy.

				<h3> Soldier of Fortune </h3>
				<p> The Soldier of fortune takes bounties on the players that they 
                    kill. They get a credit bonus every time they make the attack that
                    blows up an enemey. How much they get depends on how many 
                    players are in the game. In the event that the solider of fortune's
                    mech is destroyed and its explosion causes the destruction of 
                    another player's mech, the solider of fortune is credited for that
                    kill.</p>

				<h3> Veteran Soldier </h3>
				<p> The Veteran Soldier is more used to using their weapons in the heat
                    of combat. As such, they are slightly more accurate with them. The 
                    Veteran must select ONE of the following categories to specialize in.
                    For the duration of the game, they get a +1 to accuracy rolls when
                    using weapons of the chosen category. </p>

				<h3> Mech Engineer </h3>
				<p> The Mech Engineer is talented at reducing the unnecessary resistance in their
                    Mech's systems, and can squeeze a little more energy out of their reactors 
                    every round. They get a flat bonus to their mech's energy as detailed in the 
                    table below. </p>

				<h3> Mech Mechanic </h3>
				<p> The Mech Mechanic has the tools and skills to machine precision parts
                    that perform better. Their mech gets an additional +5 ammo storage.
                    If a mech mechanic gets shields, they get +5 strength. </p>

				<h3> Scavenger </h3>
                <p> 
                    The Scavenger can use their keen eye for recognizing specific valuable parts 
                    and their tallent for restoring broken parts to gain information about opponents'
                    mechs and potentially salvage weapons from fallen foes.</p>
				<p> 
                    Once per battle, you can inspect the wreckage of a destroyed mech. When you 
                    do, the owner of the mech must whisper to you the exact weapons they had equipped.
                    If you survive the round, you may purchase one of the weapons from the list of the
                    wreckage at an up to 15 credit discount. Inspecting wreckage follows the same rules
                    as visually inspecting mechs that haven't exploded yet. See the "Visual Inspection"
                    section in the Combat Rules.

				<h3> Banker </h3>

                    so they can outspend their opponenets. 
                </p>
				<p> At the start of every round, the Banker receives 20% interest on previously 
                    saved money (round up). Each money card that the Banker uses grants an additional +12 
                    credits <b>after round 1</b>. </p>

				<h3> Hacker </h3>
				<p> The hacker gets a bonus for selling stolen IDs from opponents hacked during the fighting.
                    The hacker gets extra credits for each unique player hacked each round. How much they get
                    per successful hack depends on how many players are playing. The hacker must use a hacking 
                    subsystem to do hacking.
