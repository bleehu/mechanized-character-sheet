                    Mechanized is a game about building a huge battle robot, called a "Mech" and 
                    then having fun blowing up your friend's Mechs and getting yours blown up, too!
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    The gameplay follows the list of phases to the right. Each phase has its own
                    rules. It may seem complex, but by-in-large, the pattern is that we get resources,
                    then we use resources to configure our robots, then we fight with our robots to see
                    who gets the best of the next round of resources. The winner is basically the 
                    player who wins the most robot fights.

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p class="rules"> 
            There are three steps to getting your mech set up at the begining of the game. These 
            steps can be taken in any order. 
        </p>
        <div class="subsystemPanel">
            <div class="subsystem">
                <h3>Draw Starting Cards</h3>
                <img src="img/z card back.png" style="width: 60px; margin: auto;" />
                <p class="rules"> 
                    When the game starts, you will be dealt a hand of 6 cards. Don't show your cards to 
                    your opponents. From this initial set, pick three cards to start in your hand. 
                    Cards do very useful things for you, such as allow your mech to move faster or 
                    shoot more accurately during combat, or purchase better weapons or systems during
                    the build phase. The cards that you start with can change the strategy that you 
                    hope to try.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Picking A Mech Chassis</h3>
                <img src="img/token_red.png" style="width: 60px; margin: auto;" />
                <p class="rules">
                    Before you can build the mech that you'll take into combat, you'll need to pick one
                    of the available battleframes to build it on. Check out the Chassis handout and 
                    choose the one that fits your strategy. The chassis that you pick will be the one
                    that you stick with through the whole game, so choose carefully. 
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    New players are encouraged to pick a chassis that are "all around-ers," like 
                    Artemis or Loki, since they are slightly easier to play.
                </p>

                <h3>Picking a Pilot Class</h3>
                <img src="img/pilot-skull_56972-24.jpg" style="width: 60px; margin: auto;" />
                <p class="rules">
                    At the start of the game you get to choose one pilot class, which gives your character 
                some helpful bonus. The class you select will be yours for the duration of the game;
                it cannot be changed mid-game. More than one player can choose the same class, but 
                no player can choose more than one class.

        <h2>Rounds</h2>
        <p class="rules">
            There are three steps that everyone goes through each round. The steps are the same for 
            every round. The steps must be done in order, and everyone does each step at the same time.

                <h3>Building</h3>
                <p class="rules">
                    Everyone gets credits at the beginning of the Build phase, and everyone makes new
                    purchases, sells old equipment, and modifies what equipment their mech has equipped
                    at the same time during the build phase. Do not let your opponents know what 
                    modifications are being made to your mech during the build phase; many strategies
                    have counters to them, and your opponent could use your purchasing decisions against 
                    you.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    For information on how to buy, sell, and build a mech, see the "Building Rules" page.

                <h3>Combat</h3>
                <p class="rules">
                    <b>Turn Order:</b>
                    Decide what order players take their turn in whatever way you see fit. Tradition
                    dictates that players roll a 12-sided dice, with the highest roll going first, but
                    feel free to spit in the face of tradition. 
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    See the Combat Rules page for details on moving, shooting, idling, and retreating.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    <b>Out of the fight:</b>
                    During Combat, players will get destroyed or will retreat from the combat area. 
                    Keep track of the order that players are knocked out of the fight. The player that
                    is the last player standing won; they came in first place. The last player that 
                    was destroyed or retreated came in second place, and so on. You gain tiebreaker points
                    equal to the place you took. So the person who came in first gets one victory point,
                    the person who came in 4th gets 4 tiebreaker points, etc. See the "declaring a winner" 
                    section below.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    Even if a player's robot with all of their weapons and subsystems is completely
                    destroyed in a hail of enemy fire and nuclear explosions, the player's Mech
                    starts the "Building Phase" after combat as if their purchases and chassis 
                    have been completely restored. You must have like a subscription to that missile 
                    launcher or whatever. Now <em>THAT'S</em> a dystopian future.

                <h3>Rewards</h3>
                <p class="rules">
                    Once combat is over, two piles of cards are dealt. The numberof cards in each 
                    pile should be 3 + the number of players. The piles are then passed to each 
                    player in the reverse of the order that each player died, starting with the 
                    survivor. Each player takes one card from the pile and passes the pile along.
                    The remaining cards are shuffled into the deck. Players cannot look at the 
                    second pile of reward cards until they have chosen their card from the first 
                    pile.
                </p>
                <p class="hint">
                    If there are three players; Albert, Brenda, and Charlie, then at the end of
                    the round, the reward pile would have 6 cards in it. If Albert survived, 
                    and Charlie died first, and Brenda died second, then Albert won the round
                    and Brenda came in second place. So Albert starts with the reward pile, 
                    chooses one card and then gives it to Brenda. Brenda then picks a card 
                    and gives the pile to Charlie. Once Charlie is done with the pile, he 
                    shuffles it into the deck. Then they do the same thing with the second 
                    reward pile.
                </p>
                <p class="rules">
                    Once all of the rewards have been alotted, the building phase of the next rounds starts!
